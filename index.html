                    <p>And our troops, well aren't they just the best?  They're just great, outstanding, incredible people. If you elect me then I'll donate 1,000,000 doses of Ivermectin<sup>©</sup> to all our veterans, past and present.  That's a big number!</p>

                    <p>Xi and Vlad won't dare cross the Donald, I've proven that already. My <em>tongue</em> is sharper than my wit and my <em>stamina</em> cannot be beaten.  And as for the rest of you gooks, mooks and knuckleheads - let it be known that Trump is coming back, and then America is coming for YOU!</p>

Except Democrats of course, but who cares?  In 30 years there won't be any left; their mass infanticide will lead to their extinction!</p>
                    <p>My fellow Americans, we all know Sleepy Joe is driving this country down a dark and treacherous road.  I warned them this would happen when he stole the election, but they didn't listen to Trump! We need to take the wheel back in 2024 before we sink into the swamp forever.  Let's ride together, let's come together, and let's make America Great Again!</p>
